Git is version control system, a tool for managing your codebase and keeping track of changes. It allows a project to be worked on by more coders and have them updated to one central place. Different builds can be staged to a specific branches which can allow you to keep testing and finished features seperate.
 GitHub is an online platform for uploading your git repo to the public. It acts as a server for all changes made to your code to be accessed by collaborators and contributors.

The terminal is where we give commands to the computer to access files. It acts a more fine tuned way to control the file explorer. As a programmer , it's more efficient to communicate directly with the terminal using codes as opposed to the explorer GUI.

Version control allows you to benefit in 3 ways;
 Changes made to your code will be tracked over time can be monitored and timestamped.
 You can roll back changes that aren't working properly to an earlier state and continue there.
 You can have collaborators work on different features seperately and have them merge their changes to a master branch.
